Cloud Computing is significantly influencing the architectural and implementation factors for IoT. Due to the nature of Cloud and IoT architectures and infrastructures, it is important to consider distributed and Decentralised Computing. With the focus on security aspects and concerns in IIoT, this chapter presents a discussion on Decentralised Computing and security concerns of Decentralised Computing from a Cloud Computing and IoT perspective. The chapter introduces the concept and definitions of Cloud Computing, Decentralised Computing, and IoT. It also addresses how Decentralised Computing is an approach to implement Cloud Architecture and IoT infrastructure, and how Cloud and IoT security concerns affect the deployment of a decentralised architecture. The above security and implementation aspects of Decentralised Computing, Cloud Computing and IoT are mapped into the context of IIoT.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, single-board computers (SBCs) have been employed more frequently in engineering and computer science (CS) at both technical and educational levels. These devices are of importance to educators and students due to several factors such as the versatility, the low cost, and the possibility to enhance the learning process through technology. However, the implications, possibilities, and constraints of these devices in engineering and CS education have not been explored in detail. In this systematic literature review, we explore how the SBCs are employed in engineering and CS and what educational results are derived from their usage in the period 2010--2020 at tertiary education level. For this, 154 studies were selected out of n = 605 collected from the academic databases Ei Compendex, Inspec, and ERIC. The analysis was carried out in two phases, identifying, for example, areas of application, learning outcomes, and students' and researchers' perceptions. The results of the review mainly indicate the following aspects: (1) The areas of laboratories and e-learning, computing education, robotics, Internet of Things, and persons with disabilities gather the studies in the review. (2) Researchers highlight the importance of the SBCs to transform the curricula in engineering and CS for the students to learn complex topics through experimentation in hands-on activities. (3) The typical cognitive learning outcomes reported by the authors are the improvement of the students' grades and the technical skills regarding the topics in the courses. Concerning the affective learning outcomes, the increase of interest, motivation, and engagement is commonly reported by the authors.},

  abstract = {The emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which will enable billions of devices to seamlessly connect with each other and to the Internet, aims to enhance the quality of daily life in diverse fields. Today, even though an abundance of IoT applications already exists, the growth of IoT is expected to accelerate in the foreseeable future. IoT applications are mainly divided into two categories: (1) consumer IoT and (2) industrial IoT (IIoT). The IIoT consists of interconnected sensors, machinery, and other ``things'' that are used in various fields of industrial applications. Throughout this chapter, the main focus is on wireless communication for IIoT applications and therefore the major challenges in designing a suitable wireless communication solution for IIoT applications are initially discussed. A comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art wireless communication standards, which are suitable for IIoT applications, is presented and representative comparisons on some of the most common industrial wireless communication technologies including 5G, the next generation of the wireless technologies, are provided. Next, we focus on one of the most significant technologies for 5G systems, namely the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), which is highly relevant for mission-critical IIoT applications. We list the challenges of URLLC and study the theoretical limits on the transmission of short packets. In these information theoretic works, latency is mostly computed as the total transmission time of a single packet. However, decoding a encoded packet is a computationally demanding operation and when we analyse complexity-constrained receivers, such as low complexity IIoT receivers, the time duration that is needed for decoding should also be taken into account in latency analysis. Finally, by including the decoding duration, we present the trade-offs in low-latency communication for receivers with computational complexity constraints.},

  abstract = {Digital Earth was born with the aim of replicating the real world within the digital world. Many efforts have been made to observe and sense the Earth, both from space (remote sensing) and by using in situ sensors. Focusing on the latter, advances in Digital Earth have established vital bridges to exploit these sensors and their networks by taking location as a key element. The current era of connectivity envisions that everything is connected to everything. The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) emerged as a holistic proposal to enable an ecosystem of varied, heterogeneous networked objects and devices to speak to and interact with each other. To make the IoT ecosystem a reality, it is necessary to understand the electronic components, communication protocols, real-time analysis techniques, and the location of the objects and devices. The IoT ecosystem and the Digital Earth (DE) jointly form interrelated infrastructures for addressing today's pressing issues and complex challenges. In this chapter, we explore the synergies and frictions in establishing an efficient and permanent collaboration between the two infrastructures, in order to adequately address multidisciplinary and increasingly complex real-world problems. Although there are still some pending issues, the identified synergies generate optimism for a true collaboration between the Internet of Things and the Digital Earth.},

  abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating--actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

  abstract = {Im Internet-of-Things (IoT) (Internet der Dinge, IdD) vernetzen sich physische Dingen mit anderen Objekt und Menschen mittels Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien des Internets. Damit erweitert das IoT Konzept das traditionelle Internet der Computer um eine Vielzahl von Zugangspunkten. Allt{\"a}gliche physische Objekte k{\"o}nnen benutzt werden um weltweit mit anderen Menschen oder Dingen zu kommunizieren. Da Objekte, Menschen und Ereignisse der realen Welt r{\"a}umliche Eigenschaften besitzen, wohnen ihren Handlungen, Beobachtungen, Zust{\"a}nden oder Geschehnissen ebenfalls Geoinformationen inne. Durch den Austausch digitaler Geoinformationen (Geodaten) im IoT kann auch von einem Geospatial IoT gesprochen werden. Dabei ist das Geospatial IoT fundamental verschieden von konventionellen Geoinformationstechnologien. Dinge im IoT liefern ihre Geodaten mit einer viel h{\"o}heren Frequenz und Menge. Die Integration dieser Dinge wird als der gr{\"o}{\ss}te revolution{\"a}re Wandel in der Geschichte von Geoinformationstechnologien angesehen. Dabei hat die allgegenw{\"a}rtige Sammlung und Bereitstellung von Geodaten durch ein Geospatial IoT gro{\ss}es Potential. Nat{\"u}rliche und von Menschen gemachte {\"O}kosysteme k{\"o}nnen so besser r{\"a}umlich erfasst, modelliert, visualisiert und verstanden werden. Es sind allerdings noch viele Herausforderungen zu l{\"o}sen um r{\"a}umliche und raumzeitliche Echtzeitdaten von IoT Ger{\"a}ten in neue oder etablierte Systeme zu integrieren. Anforderungen an Architektur und Nachrichtenaustauschmechanismus wie etwa Skalierbarkeit oder Effizienz m{\"u}ssen analysiert, evaluiert und umgesetzt werden, um eine geeignete Infrastruktur f{\"u}r ein Geospatial IoT aufzubauen. Diese Doktorarbeit fokussiert sich auf verschiedenste Forschungsfragen im Zusammenhang mit einer Infrastruktur f{\"u}r ein Geospatial IoT und der Integration von IoT Dingen, Daten und Datenstr{\"o}men in etablierte Geoinformationstechnologien. Dazu werden zun{\"a}chst typische Konzepte, Architekturen und Bausteine des IoT untersucht. Insbesondere werden neuste Entwicklungen bei der IoT Kommunikation betrachtet. Basierend auf diesen Analysen wird ein Konzept f{\"u}r eine Geospatial IoT Architektur entwickelt. Die konzeptionelle Architektur benutzt als Basisdatentyp GeoEvents, um Akteure in einem Geospatial IoT {\"u}ber einen raumzeitlichen Nachrichtenaustauschmechanismus zu verkn{\"u}pfen. Dieser Datentyp ist abgeleitet von raumzeitlichen Ereignissen aus der realen Welt. Ein GeoEvent ist ein 4-Tupel mit einem Namen, einer r{\"a}umlichen und einer zeitlichen Komponente, sowie eines Nachrichtenrumpfes. Mittels GeoEvents kann eine GeoEvent-getriebene Architektur (GeoEvent-driven Architecture) f{\"u}r ein Geospatial IoT entworfen werden. Diese folgt einem ereignisgesteuerten Muster, sodass GeoEvents direkt zum Konsumenten geschickt werden, sobald diese auftreten. Dabei k{\"o}nnen Konsumenten ihr Interesse in GeoEvents mittels einer GeoSubscription ausdr{\"u}cken. Ein GeoEvent-Prozessor evaluiert die Metainformationen jedes eingehenden GeoEvents gegen jede GeoSubscription und verteilt diese an interessierte Clients. Das IoT Protokoll Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) wird in dieser Arbeit genutzt um diese GeoEvent-getriebene Architektur prototypisch zu implementieren. MQTT erf{\"u}llt die Anforderungen zur Unterst{\"u}tzung von Ressourcen-beschr{\"a}nkten Ger{\"a}ten wie eine kleine Nachrichtengr{\"o}{\ss}e oder gute Performanz, aber auch Architektureigenschaften wie der Nachrichtenaustauschmechanismus und die Skalierbarkeit der Server. Das themen-basierte Publish/Subscribe Protokoll MQTT wird durch die Datentypen GeoEvents und GeoSubscriptions erweitert. Neue Nachrichtentypen werden in GeoMQTT eingef{\"u}hrt, um die angedachten Mechanismen umzusetzen. Ein GeoMQTT Broker verteilt die GeoEvents an Clients basierend auf den GeoSubscriptions. Dazu werden Filter-M{\"o}glichkeiten auf den Metainformationen von GeoEvents eingef{\"u}hrt, sodass GeoMQTT ein inhaltsbasiertes Publish/Subscribe umsetzt. Neben GeoMQTT Clients in verschiedenen Programmiersprachen, wird die Erweiterung GeoMQTT-SN f{\"u}r unzuverl{\"a}ssige Netzwerke entwickelt, die insbesondere auf geringe Nachrichtengr{\"o}{\ss}en achtet. Die GeoMQTT Erweiterung wird in Hinblick auf mehrere Anforderungen f{\"u}r IoT Systeme evaluiert. Sowohl die Ausdrucksst{\"a}rke f{\"u}r die Modellierung von GeoEvents als auch die Nachrichtengr{\"o}{\ss}e und die Effizienz der Filtermechanismen erf{\"u}llen die Anforderungen. Auch die Skalierbarkeit ist durch den GeoMQTT Broker sichergestellt. Schlie{\ss}lich wird das GeoMQTT Protokoll in konventionelle Geoinformationstechnologien integriert. Beispielsweise wird ein GeoMQTT Plug-in f{\"u}r QGIS implementiert, um GeoEvents in Echtzeit in einem Desktop GIS zu empfangen. Des Weiteren wird der WPS Dienst, der zum Ausf{\"u}hren von Geoprozessen genutzt wird, um neue Ein- und Ausgabeformate f{\"u}r GeoEvents erweitert, sodass Prozesse auf raumzeitlichen Datenstr{\"o}men ausgef{\"u}hrt werden k{\"o}nnen. Zus{\"a}tzlich werden Br{\"u}cken zu Sensor Web und REST Diensten vorgestellt, um archivierte oder neue GeoEvents durch Methoden des WWW abzurufen bzw. zu ver{\"o}ffentlichen. Diese Arbeit behandelt und l{\"o}st einige Herausforderungen und Anforderungen, die bei dem Aufbau einer Infrastruktur f{\"u}r das Geospatial IoT auftreten. Die prototypische Implementierung einer GeoEvent-getriebenen Architektur und zugeh{\"o}riger Dienste zeigt die M{\"o}glichkeit Dinge und Systeme in einem Geospatial IoT {\"u}ber raumzeitliche Nachrichtenaustauschmuster zu verbinden. Zus{\"a}tzlich k{\"o}nnen diese raumzeitlichen Nachrichten von verschiedenen Diensten und konventionellen Geoinformationstechnologien empfangen und angeboten werden. Dennoch sind noch weitere Herausforderungen f{\"u}r eine Implementierung des Geospatial IoT zu l{\"o}sen, auf die am Ende der Arbeit eingegangen wird. In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) things of the physical world communicate with humans and other objects by means of the Internet. The concept extends the traditional Internet of Computers (IoC) that uses computers such as desktop PC, notebooks or smartphones as access points to the Internet by a multitude of end points represented by physical objects. Since things, human beings but also events in the physical world possess various spatial properties, their actions, observations or happenings inhere geospatial information. Hence, the exchange of digital geospatial information in the IoT leads to the Geospatial IoT. The Geospatial IoT is fundamentally different from established geoinformation technologies. Things in the Geospatial IoT provide geodata with a much higher frequency and quantity. Its integration is foreseen as the most revolutionary change in the history of geoinformation technologies. The ubiquitous geodata collection and provisioning through the Geospatial IoT as an all-encompassing infrastructure holds huge potential for better spatially understanding, modeling and visualizing of our natural and artificial ecosystems. However, a lot of challenges occur in integrating spatial and spatiotemporal data from IoT devices into new or already established systems. Novel requirements concerning architectures, messaging mechanisms and technologies such as scalability or efficiency appear, which must be analyzed and considered when implementing an appropriate infrastructure. This thesis addresses different research questions regarding an infrastructure for the Geospatial IoT and its integration into established geoinformation technologies. Approaching these issues, typical concepts, architectures and buildings blocks of the IoT are investigated first. This holds especially for recent developments in the field of IoT communications on different layers. Based on these typical structures, a concept for a Geospatial IoT architecture is designed. The conceptual architecture uses GeoEvents as a base data type for exchanging spatiotemporal messages between actors in the Geospatial IoT. The data type is derived from real-world geospatial events and states, which represent occurrences and states of continuants. Basically, a GeoEvent is a four tuple with a name, a spatial component, a temporal component and a message payload. With that event type defined, a GeoEvent-driven architecture for the Geospatial IoT can be specified. It follows an event-driven pattern, so that GeoEvents are send to interested consumers when they occur. Thereby, consumers may specify their interest in GeoEvents by GeoSubscriptions. In the architecture, GeoEvents are distributed by a GeoEvent processing engine, which evaluates the meta information of the GeoEvents against filters of the GeoSubscriptions. The IoT communication protocol Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is chosen to implement the GeoEvent-driven architecture for the Geospatial IoT. It meets requirements for resource-constraint devices such as small message size and efficiency, but has also beneficial architectural properties such as the messaging paradigm or the scalability of the server. In the thesis, the topic-based publish/subscribe protocol MQTT is extended by a GeoEvent and a GeoSubscription data type. In the developed extension called GeoMQTT, new messages are introduced to encode these data types. A GeoMQTT broker distributes the GeoEvents between the clients based on the GeoSubscriptions. To achieve this, filtering capabilities on temporal and spatial components are integrated, so that GeoMQTT can be used as a content-based publish/subscribe protocol. Several clients in different programming languages are implemented, as well as a GeoMQTT-SN extension for unreliable networks. The latter one focuses especially on small message sizes. GeoMQTT is evaluated with respect to multiple requirements for IoT environments. The expressiveness of the message types as well as the efficiency of the subscribe mechanisms meet the requirements for the Geospatial IoT. Further, scalability is ensured by the GeoMQTT broker and, thus, prepared for a dynamically increasing number of things in the Geospatial IoT. Finally, the spatiotemporal messaging protocol GeoMQTT is integrated in established geoinformation technologies. For instance, a GeoMQTT plug-in for QGIS is implemented to receive GeoEvents in a desktop GIS in real-time. The WPS for executing geoprocesses is extended by new input and output data types, namely GeoPipes, so that processes on geospatial data streams can be invoked. Additionally, bridges to Sensor Web services and to REST servers provide end users or software agents access to historical or new GeoEvents by means of the WWW.The thesis approaches and solves some of the challenges and tasks occurring in building an infrastructure for the Geospatial IoT. The prototypical implementation of the GeoEvent-based architecture and its related services show that things in the Geospatial IoT can be interconnected efficiently by a spatiotemporal messaging mechanism. Real-time access is realizable by services and established geoinformation technologies may also participate. Nevertheless, there are still many ongoing issues to solve, which are addressed in the end of the thesis. Herl{\'e}, Stefan; Blankenbach, J{\"o}rg Manfred; Bill, Ralf},

This life cycle is shown in Fig. 4.1. In the following, the steps of the life cycle are described and, after that, models are introduced to support IoT application developers in each of these steps. In the following, we assume that IoT applications are developed from scratch, however, we also aim at supporting legacy applications. In this case, the models should be created in retrospect, even though the application is already set up and running. This enables an easier adaptation of the application using our introduced model based approaches.},

While existing approaches allow for fault-tolerant and scalable stream processing, we present a pipeline architecture that consists of well-known open source tools to specifically integrate spatiotemporal internet of things (IoT) data streams. In a case study, we utilize the architecture to tackle the online map matching problem, a pre-processing step for trajectory mining algorithms. Given the rising amount of vehicle location data that is generated on a daily basis, existing map matching algorithms have to be implemented in a distributed manner to be executable in a stream processing framework that provides scalability. We demonstrate how to implement state-of-the-art map matching algorithms in our distributed stream processing pipeline and analyze measured latencies.},

Three themes that have dominated are context awareness, ambient intelligence and monitoring/tracking. While these avenues of research have been fruitful their accomplishments do not match up to anything like Weiser's world. This paper discusses why this is so and argues that is time for a change of direction in the field. An alternative agenda is outlined that focuses on engaging rather than calming people. Humans are very resourceful at exploiting their environments and extending their capabilities using existing strategies and tools. I describe how pervasive technologies can be added to the mix, outlining three areas of practice where there is much potential for professionals and laypeople alike to combine, adapt and use them in creative and constructive ways.},

Then, a review of GIS and IoT integration studies is provided to examine how GIS could be used in IoT architecture. The results showed that the capabilities of GIS in dealing with geospatial data and attributes along with offering visualization and analyzing tools make it possible to develop an integrated system benefiting from real-time data collection and real-time monitoring provided by IoT.

However, there are no reports of people's direct, experiential understanding of the ``lived experience'' of context. As a result, there is a significant gap between theoretical approaches for understanding context and the actual practice of context, which is critical for the specification of systems. This paper reports the results of an ethnographic case study that illuminates the practical nature of context and highlights specific challenges for ubiquitous computing systems in general. We conclude that context is simultaneously more subtle, fluid and idiosyncratic than previously reported under theoretical approaches to understanding context. We further suggest implications for the design of computing systems based on these findings.},

These networks provide a continuous pulse of the almost infinite activities that are happening in the physical space and are thus, key enablers for a Digital Earth Nervous System. Nevertheless, the rapid processing of these sensor data streams still continues to challenge traditional data-handling solutions and new approaches are being requested. We propose a generic answer to this challenge, which has the potential to support any form of distributed real-time analysis. This neutral methodology follows a brokering approach to work with different kinds of data sources and uses web-based standards to achieve interoperability. As a proof of concept, we implemented the methodology to detect anomalies in real-time and applied it to the area of environmental monitoring. The developed system is capable of detecting anomalies, generating notifications, and displaying the recent situation to the user.},

Ubiquit{\"a}re Systeme agieren quasi unsichtbar im Hintergrund unseres Handlungsfeldes. Bei den bisherigen Realisierungen handelt es sich um lokal begrenzte und anwendungsspezifische L{\"o}sungen, die in unterschiedlichen informatischen und nachrichtentechnischen Technologien konkretisiert sind.},

  abstract = {The advancement in technology has depreciated the size of the gadget by leaps and bounds during the last few decades. The usage and dependence of human beings on electronic gadgets has grown exponentially with the passage of time. The substantial scaling of such kind of devices gave birth to a new technology called `Internet of Things' (IoT) in the year 1999. The concept of IoT adheres to the need of round the clock and ubiquitous connectivity. It provides means for establishing interconnectivity and interactions between such devices. IoT has carved out the path for new innovations leading to novel type of communication among humans and things. The interactions would enable the realization of services utilizing these resources for improving the quality of life. This chapter is an attempt in this direction with the basic introduction of IoT, basic architectures, challenges and the plethora of services provided by IoT.},
